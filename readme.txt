This program creates 3 "colonies" that each fight for control of the board. They are set to have the same stats, but can be altered in 
the code. These stats are speed, attack, and defense. Speed determines rate of expansion, where the stat is the percent chance it expands
to an adjacent square. Attack and defense determines whether one colony can expand into another, where if the attack of colony is greater 
than the defense of the other, it can take over their cell. Press 0 to reset the board, click on the board to place a cell, press R, G,
or B to determine which colony is pressed, press 1 to randomize the board, press space to advance one turn, and press esc to exit the program
